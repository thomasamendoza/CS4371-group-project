      <h1>A Look at Some Popular Breeds</h1>

      <!-- Australian Shepherd -->
      <div class="breed-card">
        <h2>Australian Shepherd</h2>
        <img
          src="/images/aussie.jpg"
          alt="Australian Shepherd dog"
          class="breed-image"
        />
        <p>
          Known for their intelligence, high energy, and striking merle coats,
          Australian Shepherds are excellent herding dogs and active companions.
          They thrive with owners who can provide plenty of physical exercise
          and mental stimulation.
        </p>

      <!-- Corgi -->
      <div class="breed-card">
        <h2>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</h2>
        <img
          src="/images/corgi.jpg"
          alt="Pembroke Welsh Corgi dog"
          class="breed-image"
        />
        <p>
          Instantly recognizable by their short legs, long body, and foxy face,
          Corgis are affectionate, smart, and surprisingly athletic. They have a
          big-dog bark in a small package and make loyal family pets.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Maltese -->
      <div class="breed-card">
        <h2>Maltese</h2>
        <img src="/images/maltese.jpg" alt="Maltese dog" class="breed-image" />
        <p>
          These small, gentle dogs are covered in a long, silky white coat.
          Maltese are playful, charming, and thrive on human companionship.
          Despite their aristocratic bearing, they enjoy playtime and make great
          lap dogs.
        </p>

      <!-- American Shorthair... Cat? -->
      <div class="breed-card cat-card">
        <h2>American Shorthair... Cat?</h2>
        <img
          src="/images/cat.jpg"
          alt="American Shorthair cat"
          class="breed-image"
        />
        <p>
          Wait a minute... this isn't a dog! Looks like someone snuck a cat onto
          the list! The American Shorthair is a popular <em>feline</em>
          breed known for its easygoing temperament, robust health, and classic
          tabby patterns. While not a canine, they certainly make wonderful
          companions too! (Someone might need to double-check their breed list
          next time!)
