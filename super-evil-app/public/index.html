      <h3><a id="linkC2HCH0001"></a> Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival</h3>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the 24th of February,
        1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde signalled the three-master, the
        <i>Pharaon</i> from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples.
      </p>
      <p>
        As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d’If, got on
        board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were
        covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to come
        into port, especially when this ship, like the <i>Pharaon</i>, has been built,
        rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an owner of the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic shock
        has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled Pomègue, and
        approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but so slowly and
        sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil,
        asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board. However, those
        experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred, it was
        not to the vessel herself, for she bore down with all the evidence of being
        skilfully handled, the anchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off,
        and standing by the side of the pilot, who was steering the <i>Pharaon</i>
        towards the narrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with
        activity and vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each
        direction of the pilot.
      </p>
      <p>
        The vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected
        one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor, but
        jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled alongside the <i>Pharaon</i>,
        which he reached as she rounded into La Réserve basin.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his station by
        the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship’s bulwarks.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black eyes,
        and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole appearance bespoke that
        calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend
        with danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ah, is it you, Dantès?” cried the man in the skiff. “What’s the matter? and
        why have you such an air of sadness aboard?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “A great misfortune, M. Morrel,” replied the young man, “a great misfortune,
        for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave Captain Leclere.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “And the cargo?” inquired the owner, eagerly.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that head. But
        poor Captain Leclere——”
      </p>
      <p>
        “What happened to him?” asked the owner, with an air of considerable
        resignation. “What happened to the worthy captain?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “He died.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Fell into the sea?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “No, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.” Then turning to the crew,
        he said, “Bear a hand there, to take in sail!”
      </p>
      <p>
        All hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew,
        sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and outhaul, topsail
        sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail clewlines and buntlines.
        The young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and
        accurately obeyed, and then turned again to the owner.
      </p>
      <p>
        “And how did this misfortune occur?” inquired the latter, resuming the
        interrupted conversation.
      </p>
      <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
        <img alt="[Illustration: Edmond Dantès]" height="550" src="images/0023m.jpg" width="464"
          id="img_images_0023m.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>
        “Alas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with the
        harbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind. In
        twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days afterwards.
        We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his rest, sewn up in his
        hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head and his heels, off El Giglio
        island. We bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor. It was worth while,
        truly,” added the young man with a melancholy smile, “to make war against the
        English for ten years, and to die in his bed at last, like everybody else.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Why, you see, Edmond,” replied the owner, who appeared more comforted at every
        moment, “we are all mortal, and the old must make way for the young. If not,
        why, there would be no promotion; and since you assure me that the cargo——”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Is all safe and sound, M. Morrel, take my word for it; and I advise you not to
        take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, as they were just passing the Round Tower, the young man shouted: “Stand
        by there to lower the topsails and jib; brail up the spanker!”
      </p>
      <p>
        The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a man-of-war.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Let go—and clue up!” At this last command all the sails were lowered, and the
        vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Now, if you will come on board, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, observing the owner’s
        impatience, “here is your supercargo, M. Danglars, coming out of his cabin, who
        will furnish you with every particular. As for me, I must look after the
        anchoring, and dress the ship in mourning.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The owner did not wait for a second invitation. He seized a rope which Dantès
        flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor,
        climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man, going to his task, left
        the conversation to Danglars, who now came towards the owner. He was a man of
        twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, of unprepossessing countenance,
        obsequious to his superiors, insolent to his subordinates; and this, in
        addition to his position as responsible agent on board, which is always
        obnoxious to the sailors, made him as much disliked by the crew as Edmond
        Dantès was beloved by them.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well, M. Morrel,” said Danglars, “you have heard of the misfortune that has
        befallen us?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes—yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest man.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “And a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable service, as
        became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of
        Morrel &amp; Son,” replied Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        “But,” replied the owner, glancing after Dantès, who was watching the anchoring
        of his vessel, “it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say,
        Danglars, to understand his business, for our friend Edmond seems to understand
        it thoroughly, and not to require instruction from anyone.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes,” said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate. “Yes, he is
        young, and youth is invariably self-confident. Scarcely was the captain’s
        breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone,
        and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the Island of Elba, instead of
        making for Marseilles direct.”
      </p>
      <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
        <img alt="0025m" src="images/0025m.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="img_images_0025m.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>
        “As to taking command of the vessel,” replied Morrel, “that was his duty as
        captain’s mate; as to losing a day and a half off the Island of Elba, he was
        wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “The vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you are, M.
        Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the pleasure of
        going ashore, and nothing else.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Dantès,” said the shipowner, turning towards the young man, “come this way!”
      </p>
      <p>
        “In a moment, sir,” answered Dantès, “and I’m with you.” Then calling to the
        crew, he said, “Let go!”
      </p>
      <p>
        The anchor was instantly dropped, and the chain ran rattling through the
        port-hole. Dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot,
        until this manœuvre was completed, and then he added, “Half-mast the
        colors, and square the yards!”
      </p>
      <p>
        “You see,” said Danglars, “he fancies himself captain already, upon my word.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “And so, in fact, he is,” said the owner.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Except your signature and your partner’s, M. Morrel.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “And why should he not have this?” asked the owner; “he is young, it is true,
        but he seems to me a thorough seaman, and of full experience.”
      </p>
      <p>
        A cloud passed over Danglars’ brow.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Your pardon, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, approaching, “the vessel now rides at
        anchor, and I am at your service. You hailed me, I think?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars retreated a step or two. “I wished to inquire why you stopped at the
        Island of Elba?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I do not know, sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain Leclere,
        who, when dying, gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Then did you see him, Edmond?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Who?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “The marshal.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel looked around him, and then, drawing Dantès on one side, he said
        suddenly—
      </p>
      <p>
        “And how is the emperor?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Very well, as far as I could judge from the sight of him.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “You saw the emperor, then?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “He entered the marshal’s apartment while I was there.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “And you spoke to him?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Why, it was he who spoke to me, sir,” said Dantès, with a smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        “And what did he say to you?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Asked me questions about the vessel, the time she left Marseilles, the course
        she had taken, and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had not been laden,
        and I had been her master, he would have bought her. But I told him I was only
        mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel &amp; Son. ‘Ah, yes,’ he
        said, ‘I know them. The Morrels have been shipowners from father to son; and
        there was a Morrel who served in the same regiment with me when I was in
        garrison at Valence.’”
      </p>
      <p>
        “<i>Pardieu!</i> and that is true!” cried the owner, greatly delighted. “And
        that was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was afterwards a captain. Dantès, you
        must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him, and you will see it will
        bring tears into the old soldier’s eyes. Come, come,” continued he, patting
        Edmond’s shoulder kindly, “you did very right, Dantès, to follow Captain
        Leclere’s instructions, and touch at Elba, although if it were known that you
        had conveyed a packet to the marshal, and had conversed with the emperor, it
        might bring you into trouble.”
      </p>
      <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
        <img alt="0027m" src="images/0027m.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="img_images_0027m.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>
        “How could that bring me into trouble, sir?” asked Dantès; “for I did not even
        know of what I was the bearer; and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he
        would of the first comer. But, pardon me, here are the health officers and the
        customs inspectors coming alongside.” And the young man went to the gangway. As
        he departed, Danglars approached, and said,—
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well, it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at
        Porto-Ferrajo?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes, most satisfactory, my dear Danglars.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well, so much the better,” said the supercargo; “for it is not pleasant to
        think that a comrade has not done his duty.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Dantès has done his,” replied the owner, “and that is not saying much. It was
        Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Talking of Captain Leclere, has not Dantès given you a letter from him?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “To me?—no—was there one?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I believe that, besides the packet, Captain Leclere confided a letter to his
        care.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Of what packet are you speaking, Danglars?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Why, that which Dantès left at Porto-Ferrajo.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “How do you know he had a packet to leave at Porto-Ferrajo?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars turned very red.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I was passing close to the door of the captain’s cabin, which was half open,
        and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dantès.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “He did not speak to me of it,” replied the shipowner; “but if there be any
        letter he will give it to me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars reflected for a moment. “Then, M. Morrel, I beg of you,” said he, “not
        to say a word to Dantès on the subject. I may have been mistaken.”
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment the young man returned; Danglars withdrew.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well, my dear Dantès, are you now free?” inquired the owner.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes, sir.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “You have not been long detained.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “No. I gave the custom-house officers a copy of our bill of lading; and as to
        the other papers, they sent a man off with the pilot, to whom I gave them.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Then you have nothing more to do here?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “No—everything is all right now.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Then you can come and dine with me?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I really must ask you to excuse me, M. Morrel. My first visit is due to my
        father, though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me.”
      </p>
      <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
        <img alt="0029m" src="images/0029m.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="img_images_0029m.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>
        “Right, Dantès, quite right. I always knew you were a good son.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “And,” inquired Dantès, with some hesitation, “do you know how my father is?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “That proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your absence.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès smiled. “My father is proud, sir, and if he had not a meal left, I doubt
        if he would have asked anything from anyone, except from Heaven.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on you.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I must again excuse myself, M. Morrel, for after this first visit has been
        paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “True, Dantès, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who expects you
        no less impatiently than your father—the lovely Mercédès.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès blushed.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ah, ha,” said the shipowner, “I am not in the least surprised, for she has
        been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the <i>Pharaon</i>.
        <i>Peste!</i> Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!”
      </p>
      <p>
        “She is not my mistress,” replied the young sailor, gravely; “she is my
        betrothed.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Sometimes one and the same thing,” said Morrel, with a smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Not with us, sir,” replied Dantès.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well, well, my dear Edmond,” continued the owner, “don’t let me detain you.
        You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all the time you
        require for your own. Do you want any money?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “No, sir; I have all my pay to take—nearly three months’ wages.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “You are a careful fellow, Edmond.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Say I have a poor father, sir.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see your
        father. I have a son too, and I should be very wroth with those who detained
        him from me after a three months’ voyage.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Then I have your leave, sir?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes, if you have nothing more to say to me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Nothing.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Captain Leclere did not, before he died, give you a letter for me?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “He was unable to write, sir. But that reminds me that I must ask your leave of
        absence for some days.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “To get married?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes, first, and then to go to Paris.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Very good; have what time you require, Dantès. It will take quite six weeks to
        unload the cargo, and we cannot get you ready for sea until three months after
        that; only be back again in three months, for the <i>Pharaon</i>,” added the
        owner, patting the young sailor on the back, “cannot sail without her captain.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Without her captain!” cried Dantès, his eyes sparkling with animation; “pray
        mind what you say, for you are touching on the most secret wishes of my heart.
        Is it really your intention to make me captain of the <i>Pharaon</i>?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “If I were sole owner we’d shake hands on it now, my dear Dantès, and call it
        settled; but I have a partner, and you know the Italian proverb—<i>Chi ha
          compagno ha padrone</i>—‘He who has a partner has a master.’ But the thing is
        at least half done, as you have one out of two votes. Rely on me to procure you
        the other; I will do my best.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ah, M. Morrel,” exclaimed the young seaman, with tears in his eyes, and
        grasping the owner’s hand, “M. Morrel, I thank you in the name of my father and
        of Mercédès.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “That’s all right, Edmond. There’s a providence that watches over the
        deserving. Go to your father; go and see Mercédès, and afterwards come to me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Shall I row you ashore?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “No, thank you; I shall remain and look over the accounts with Danglars. Have
        you been satisfied with him this voyage?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “That is according to the sense you attach to the question, sir. Do you mean is
        he a good comrade? No, for I think he never liked me since the day when I was
        silly enough, after a little quarrel we had, to propose to him to stop for ten
        minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle the dispute—a proposition which
        I was wrong to suggest, and he quite right to refuse. If you mean as
        responsible agent when you ask me the question, I believe there is nothing to
        say against him, and that you will be content with the way in which he has
        performed his duty.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “But tell me, Dantès, if you had command of the <i>Pharaon</i> should you be
        glad to see Danglars remain?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Captain or mate, M. Morrel, I shall always have the greatest respect for those
        who possess the owners’ confidence.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “That’s right, that’s right, Dantès! I see you are a thoroughly good fellow,
        and will detain you no longer. Go, for I see how impatient you are.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Then I have leave?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Go, I tell you.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “May I have the use of your skiff?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Certainly.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Then, for the present, M. Morrel, farewell, and a thousand thanks!”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I hope soon to see you again, my dear Edmond. Good luck to you.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The young sailor jumped into the skiff, and sat down in the stern sheets, with
        the order that he be put ashore at La Canebière. The two oarsmen bent to their
        work, and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of
        the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two
        rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the Quai d’Orléans.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shipowner, smiling, followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out
        on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng, which from five o’clock
        in the morning until nine o’clock at night, swarms in the famous street of La
        Canebière,—a street of which the modern Phocéens are so proud that they say
        with all the gravity in the world, and with that accent which gives so much
        character to what is said, “If Paris had La Canebière, Paris would be a second
        Marseilles.” On turning round the owner saw Danglars behind him, apparently
        awaiting orders, but in reality also watching the young sailor,—but there was a
        great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the
        movements of Edmond Dantès.

  <h1>The Dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris)</h1>

  <p>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from
    an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be
    domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture. Due to their long
    association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for
    other canids.</p>

  <p>Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in
    shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that
    house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared to humans, dogs possess a
    superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as
    hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police
    and the military.</p>

  <p>Communication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of
    bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). They mark their territories by
    urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new environment. Over the millennia, dogs have uniquely
    adapted to human behavior; this adaptation includes being able to understand and communicate with humans. As such,
    the human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent study, and dogs' influence on human society has given them the
    sobriquet of "man's best friend".</p>

  <p>The global dog population is estimated at 700 million to 1 billion, distributed around the world. The dog is the
    most popular pet in the United States, present in 34–40% of households. Developed countries make up approximately
    20% of the global dog population, while around 75% of dogs are estimated to be from developing countries, mainly in
    the form of feral and community dogs.</p>
