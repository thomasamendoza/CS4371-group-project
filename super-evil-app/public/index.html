    <h1>The Dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris)</h1>

    <p>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from
      an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be
      domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture. Due to their long
      association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for
      other canids.</p>

    <p>Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in
      shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that
      house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared to humans, dogs possess a
      superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as
      hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police
      and the military.</p>

    <p>Communication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of
      bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). They mark their territories by
      urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new environment. Over the millennia, dogs have uniquely
      adapted to human behavior; this adaptation includes being able to understand and communicate with humans. As such,
      the human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent study, and dogs' influence on human society has given them the
      sobriquet of "man's best friend".</p>

    <p>The global dog population is estimated at 700 million to 1 billion, distributed around the world. The dog is the
      most popular pet in the United States, present in 34–40% of households. Developed countries make up approximately
      20% of the global dog population, while around 75% of dogs are estimated to be from developing countries, mainly in
      the form of feral and community dogs.</p>
